# testing-for-good-template
This is a template repository to get the basic structure of testing for good events

[#testing4good](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Testing4Good)

In this automation best practices workshop you will learn the latest and greatest tools and techniques to drastically improve your testing!

We will focus on a holistic approach of testing front-end and back-end, web and APIs, functional testing, component testing, and many other things in between üòÅ

This workshop serves 2 purposes:

1. To pay it forward to the testing world and help us all upskill üöÄ
2. For us all to help a cause greater than ourselves üåç

### [About Black Girls CODE](https://www.blackgirlscode.com/about-us/)

We build pathways for young women of color to embrace the current tech marketplace as builders and creators by introducing them to skills in computer programming and technology.

Radical action is needed if we are to close the opportunity gap for Black women and girls. We lead a global movement to establish equal representation in the tech sector. Black Girls CODE is devoted to showing the world that Black girls can code and do so much more. Together, we are creating stronger economies and more equitable societies‚Äîultimately realizing the true potential of democracy through diversity and inclusion.

üëâ While the event is free, Sauce Labs encourages all attendees to donate to Black Girls Code. Sauce Labs Office of Inclusion & Sustainability will match donations up to $2500

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup

The safest way to ensure that we all have the same environment is for us to [use Gitpod](#gitpod-setup) for our workshop. However, if you are comfortable doing so, you are free to setup the environment on your machine as well.

### Sign up for accounts

1. Free [Sauce account](https://saucelabs.com/sign-up)

### Get your username and api key

1. Save your Sauce Labs Username and Access Key by going to the [Sauce Labs user settings page](https://app.saucelabs.com/user-settings)

‚ÑπÔ∏è If you have a Screener.io account then do the step below. Otherwise, just copy one of the demo API Keys.
  - Save your Screener API Key by going to the [API key](https://screener.io/v2/account/api-key) page in your Screener settings
     - Need to sign up for [demo account before](https://saucelabs.com/demo-request-vt)

üö® **If you don't get an API key before the workshop, please use one of the keys below** üö®

SCREENER_API_KEY:

`34c95634-56fc-446e-b68e-20530262e3f4`

`fe5a0636-fde5-4209-a597-403a76f1b505`

`6b3cc9f4-4578-413c-b5cc-ed7d1b417981`

## Gitpod setup

‚ÑπÔ∏è Gitpod lets you run an entire Dev environment from a browser! You can use this approach if you don't know how to setup a local environment.

### Fork the repo

1. Sign up for a free [Github account](https://github.com/)
2. Fork this respository

- Make sure you are logged into Github
- click the Fork in the upper right of the Github.
- Give the repo a ‚≠ê or you can't participate in the workshopüòù

3. In the browser address bar, prepend the current GitHub url with `https://gitpod.io/#`

   - The resulting url should look as follows:

     > https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/comprehensive-testing-js

4. Once the Gitpod.io URL is loaded, you will need to sign in with the GitHub account you created earlier

### ‚úÖ A new tab open with a simple ReactJS application should open

‚ÑπÔ∏è Keep the app running, we will need it to run some sanity tests

### Set your env variables

In a new terminal, run the following commands in that Terminal to set your `SAUCE_USERNAME`, `SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY`, and `SCREENER_API_KEY`:

```bash
eval $(gp env -e SAUCE_USERNAME=<sauce_username>)
```
```bash
eval $(gp env -e SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY=<sauce_access_key>)
```
```bash
eval $(gp env -e SCREENER_API_KEY=<screener_api_key>)
```

> Replace <sauce_username>, <sauce_access_key>, and <screener_api_key> with your credentials

Once you have run those 3 commands, you can run the following commands to test your environment variables:

```bash
echo $SAUCE_USERNAME
echo $SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY
echo $SCREENER_API_KEY
```

### ‚úÖ Your values should come back as expected

### Run tests

Run sanity tests

If your tests run in US Datacenter

```bash
npm run test:sanity:us
```

If your tests run in EU Datacenter

```bash
npm run test:sanity:eu
```

### ‚úÖüëèEnvironment setup is complete if tests passed

---

## Local setup

### 1. Install Node LTS

1.  Use NVM for this installation by [following instructions](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#install--update-script)
    - It should be just a single command to run in our terminal
      - **!Don't forget to restart your terminal!**
    - After installation, confirm install with `nvm --version`
2.  Intall Node 16 with `nvm install --lts`

- Confirm node installation with `node --version` and seeing `v16.x` or similar
- Confirm NVM is set to 16 for default by running the following commands:

```bash
nvm list #will show all versions
nvm use 16 #to use 16
nvm alias default 16.14.x #to set it to the default
```

### 2.Clone and fork the repo

1. Sign up for a free [Github account](https://github.com/)
2. Fork this respository

- Make sure you are logged into Github
- click the Fork in the upper right of the Github.

3. Clone your fork of the repository to your machine. Must have [Git installed](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

```bash
git clone URL_OF_YOUR_FORK
```

4. **Navigate to the directory of where you cloned your repo**

```bash
cd YOUR_FORK_DIR/comprehensive-testing-js
```

### 3. Install dependencies and start the application

- While inside your 'comprehensive-testing-js' directory, run the following command to install all dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

- After the dependency installation has completed, start the application by running the following:

```bash
npm run start
```

### 4.Follow the rest of the setup instructions

Follow the [same steps](#Run-tests) for running tests.

‚ÑπÔ∏è The main difference is that you will set environmenta variables by [following these instructions](https://docs.saucelabs.com/basics/environment-variables/#setting-up-environment-variables) depending on your OS.

‚ÑπÔ∏è Some individuals aren't allowed to set their environment variables on their machines (Employer policy). In that case, you can hardcode them by modifying

- [3 visual keys](https://github.com/saucelabs-training/comprehensive-testing-js/blob/9309d16a9cf56dd14607b9e4c478f3b2f698e9d8/wdio.visual.conf.js#L2-L9)
- [2 keys for functional tests](https://github.com/saucelabs-training/comprehensive-testing-js/blob/9309d16a9cf56dd14607b9e4c478f3b2f698e9d8/wdio.sanity.conf.js#L9-L10)

You will need to hardcode these values as we do exercises.

### 5.Have an IDE installed that can handle NodeJS/JS (We will use [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download))

#### ‚úÖüëèCongratulations, your local environment is ready!

## Prizes

Prizes will be given away for participation (tshirts, stickers...)

At the end, one lucky winner will get a backpack!
